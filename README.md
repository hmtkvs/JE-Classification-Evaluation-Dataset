# Job Offer and Applicant CV Classification Using Rich Information from a Labour Market Taxonomy

This repository contains the evaluation dataset used in our paper titled "Job Offer and Applicant CV Classification Using Rich Information from a Labour Market Taxonomy". 

## Dataset

The dataset is a static snapshot containing some fictional job class specs information. Typically, job class specs have information which characterize the job class- its features, and a label- in this case a pay grade - something to predict that the features are related to.

### Content

The dataset has the following structure:

|       | job_title    | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | skills   | esco_id                                   |

Please note that this data is purely fictional.

### Inspiration

The intent is to use machine learning classification algorithms to predict PG from Educational level through to Financial budget information. Typically, job classification in HR is time consuming and cumbersome as a manual activity. The intent is to show how machine learning and People Analytics can be brought to bear on this task.
